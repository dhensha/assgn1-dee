<h1>Project Name: Foodiez Loco</h1>
<p>My project is about a webiste that shows food that is sold in a actual restaurent, these food that is sold is commonly eaten food in social media such as TikTok and Instagaram. Customers can chose their favourite food from the menu's called "Meals" and "Desserts" and order it in the contact page by calling the restaurent and telling them their order and the resturent will send them to their house within 5 to 10 minutes. This is a buisness I created beacuse I love food and the varieties of food that exist around the world and also viral as they are very tasty and aesthatically nice to take pctures and post in social media. </p>

<p> I got inspired by many food vlogs and youtube videos I watch to make this website and since I love anime too, I added a little snippet of it in my home page. I breifly did a About us page too so that customers briefly can know what our company is about and how it got created in the first place. Why the customers can't order from the website? To me I believe thats a hassle, as we need do alot procedures, but with a conatct page and simple call to the company, the food will arive in minutes and have the customers enjoy the food happily with a great service done </p>
